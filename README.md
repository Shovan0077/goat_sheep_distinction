# goat_sheep_distinction
This project aims to distinguish and identify goat or sheep from an image.

The dataset used is "sheep-goat.zip" from kaggle.


The Approach I followed in this project :-

Step 1 -- Loaded API.

Step 2 -- Downloaded dataset followed by unzipping the zipped dataset.

Step 3 -- Imported necessary libraries.

Step 4 -- Preprocessed images along with data augmentation.

Step 5 -- Created train and validation generators.

Step 6 -- Built the CNN model.

Step 7 -- Trained the CNN model.

Step 8 -- Evaluated the model using visulaizing tools.

Step 9 -- Predicted class of new input image.
