# goat_sheep_distinction
\nThis project aims to distinguish and identify goat or sheep from an image.
\nThe dataset used is "sheep-goat.zip" from kaggle.
\nThe Approach I followed in this project :-
\nStep 1 -- Loaded API
\nStep 2 -- Downloaded dataset followed by unzipping the zipped dataset.
\nStep 3 -- Imported Libraries
\nStep 4 -- Preprocessed images along with data augmentation
\nStep 5 -- Created train and validation generators
\nStep 6 -- Built the CNN model
\nStep 7 -- Trained the CNN model
\nStep 8 -- Evaluated the model using visulaizing tools
\nStep 9 -- Predicted class of new input image
